# Fusion

Fusion is a versatile macro assembler language that can also be used to create any type of binary file from source code.
It features a straightforward syntax for defining CPU commands as well as using them in programs.

If you're designing your own CPU and need a simple way to implement a macro assembler, Fusion is the language for you.
See [Docs](Source/Docs/LanguageDoc.md) folder for details.

## How to build
To build use Visual Studio. If you build release configuration it will zip up build output with samples and documentation.
You will need 7-Zip installed for this.
